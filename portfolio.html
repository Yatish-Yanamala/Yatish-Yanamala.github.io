  <p>The Chipotle Bowl Project by Chetan Reddy Yanamala and Yatish Yanamala is an interactive program that allows users to customize a bowl by selecting toppings, which are then visually represented using the Turtle module. With 32 possible combinations, the program translates user choices into simplified graphical elements, such as a green line for guacamole or a circle for beans. The project overcame challenges like centering the rice using the `.dot` method instead of `.circle`. The code includes specific implementations for beans, sour cream, and chicken/vegetables, demonstrating the flexibility of the program in generating various bowl designs.</p>

  <p>Our Minecraft game challenges players to catch falling apples in a basket while navigating an immersive setting. With user input for movement, a progressive difficulty system, and a three-strike rule, players must react quickly to avoid losing lives. A dynamic scoreboard tracks scores, and a leaderboard with long-term memory keeps records. The game increases the drop rate of apples and evil chorus fruits to be avoided over time, adding excitement and challenge.</p>

  <p>In this fast-paced Tom and Jerry-inspired game, you play as the cunning cat, dashing across the screen to catch sneaky rats while dodging fierce hounds charging in from the sides. As the game progresses, the rats get quicker, and the dogs become more unpredictable, forcing you to react swiftly to survive. With a three-strike rule keeping the tension high, every move counts—miss too many rats or get caught by a dog, and it's game over! A dynamic scoreboard tracks your success, while a long-term leaderboard lets you compete for the top spot. Stay sharp, move fast, and prove you're the ultimate rat-catcher!</p>

  <p>In our fish tank project, we walked through a attempt at phishing and crawled through everything from files and emails and debugged a vulnerability in fish tank code through the iteration of the native VS code debugger.</p>

  <p>We compared the rover's sensor graphs to the known environmental data to identify the Rocky Mountain region. Most of the data — including sound, temperature, and wind — showed similar patterns between the Rocky Mountains and the Desert Plains, which made it challenging to distinguish between the two at first. However, the light data stood out as the key difference. While both regions experience intense light during the day, the Rocky Mountains had noticeable dips in light due to cloud cover, unlike the consistently bright conditions in the Desert Plains. This difference helped us confidently match the graphs to the Rocky Mountain region.</p>
